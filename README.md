Hi, 
This is Time Shift Proof-ofWork.Original idea by Jack Liao. Publiced on Apr 28, 2019

There are several known ways to attack Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain consensus mechanism. All of them
assume having access to a majority of hash power for a period of time . Making these attacks harder could
involve, for example, increasing necessary for a successful attack. Time Shift Proof-of-Work (TSPoW) is an
effort in that direction. Among other things, a successful attack on TSPoW requires maintaining the majority of
hash power during two precise time windows.
In bitcoin proof of work, two operations - 1) creating a new block and 2) finding a solution to a block, are closely
tied together. Time Shift Proof-of-Work (TSPOW) separates them in time. That is why rewriting the history of
the blockchain sequence becomes even harder than in the Nakamoto consensus.
Join to make it happen.
